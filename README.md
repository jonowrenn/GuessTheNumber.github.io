# Guess the Number Game

A simple Java console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. The program provides feedback:
   - If the guess is too low, it prompts "Higher, try again."
   - If the guess is too high, it prompts "Lower, try again."
   - If the guess is correct, it congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts.

## Features

- Randomly generated number ensures replayability.
- Provides feedback to help the player zero in on the correct number.
- Tracks the number of guesses made.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your system.
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, or a text editor with terminal access).
